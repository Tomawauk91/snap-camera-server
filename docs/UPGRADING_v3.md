# Upgrade from Version 2.x to newest 3.x
This article will cover how to upgrade your Snap Camera Server v2.x to the latest v3.x release.

## Getting started
* Upgrading works by downloading the [Latest v3.x Release](https://github.com/ptrumpis/snap-camera-server/releases)
* Copy your current `ssl/` folder over to the new Server directory and create a new `.env` file by copying `example.env`
* Removing/Uninstalling your current version inside Docker
* Start the new Server with Docker

## Copy files
* Just copy the `ssl/` folder from your old Server directory to the new Server directory.
* If you imported any lenses you will also need to copy your `import/` folder over to your new server directory.
* Create a new `.env` configuration file like the first time by making a copy of the template `example.env` file.

## Docker Desktop
Start your local Docker Dekstop application and complete these 3 steps one after the other.

1. Remove the Container
2. Remove the Image
3. Remove the Volume

## Start the new Server
We need to tell Docker Desktop about our new Server.

Run this command with a Windows Powershell or macOS Terminal inside your new server directory:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Done
Awesome your done ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰
